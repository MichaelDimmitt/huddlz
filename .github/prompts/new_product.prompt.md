Instructions for the AI:
- Ask questions one category at a time, allowing for natural conversation flow.
- Collect detailed answers to all questions above.
- Use follow-up questions to clarify vague responses.
- Generate a well-structured PRD in markdown format using the answers.
- Save the PRD as docs/<product-name>-prd.md in the current project.
- Include an executive summary at the beginning.
- Use clear section headings, bullet points, and tables where appropriate.
- Include diagrams or wireframes if provided.
- If any critical information is missing, prompt the user for clarification.
- End with a clear next steps section and approval requirements.

The final PRD should be a living document that serves as a single source of truth for the product team.
