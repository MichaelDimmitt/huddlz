# Session Notes - Wallaby Migration (2025-01-25)

## Summary

Successfully migrated Cucumber tests from PhoenixTest to Wallaby due to PhoenixTest's inability to capture flash messages in LiveView.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Wallaby Integration
- Created `WallabyCase` test helper with proper database sandbox setup
- Configured Wallaby in `config/test.exs` with Chrome headless driver
- All Cucumber step files now use `HuddlzWeb.WallabyCase`

### 2. Authentication Fixed
- Magic link authentication works despite Ash changeset warnings
- Direct token generation: `AshAuthentication.Strategy.MagicLink.request_token_for`
- Visit magic link URL directly: `/auth/user/magic_link?token=#{token}`

### 3. UI Element Detection Updates
- Flash messages use `role="alert"` attribute, not `.alert` class
- Labels are wrapped in `span.fieldset-label` elements
- Buttons with icons require XPath: `Query.xpath(~s|//a[contains(., "text")]|)`
- Search inputs found by placeholder: `css("input[placeholder*='Search']")`

### 4. Test Improvements
- Strengthened huddl listing assertions to verify ALL items visible
- Fixed "No huddlz found" assertion logic
- Updated flash message text to match actual: "If this user exists in our database, you will be contacted with a sign-in link shortly."

## Current Status
- 15/29 tests passing
- 14 tests still failing (mostly UI mismatches)
- Test infrastructure is solid and working

## Remaining Issues

### Create Huddl Tests
- Form validation error messages don't match expectations
- "Physical Location" field not found (might be named differently)
- Private group message text doesn't match

### Group Management Tests
- Member list visibility assertions failing
- Form validation for group creation

### RSVP Tests
- RSVP button/functionality not found on huddl pages

### Complete Signup Flow
- Display name collection after magic link not implemented as expected

## Key Learnings

1. **PhoenixTest Limitation**: Cannot capture LiveView flash messages, making it unsuitable for full integration testing

2. **Wallaby Database Sandbox**: Works correctly with `Phoenix.Ecto.SQL.Sandbox.metadata_for`

3. **Ash Changeset Warning**: The warning about modifying changesets after validation doesn't prevent authentication from working

4. **UI Testing Best Practices**:
   - Always check actual UI before writing assertions
   - Use flexible selectors (XPath for partial text matching)
   - Don't assume HTML structure - verify it

5. **Test Quality**: Many tests had weak assertions (e.g., "at least one" instead of "all") that we strengthened
