# Session: Ash Framework Documentation Organization

**Date:** May 6, 2025

## Goals

- Organize the large Ash Framework documentation file for better maintainability
- Split the ~4,000-line file into topic-focused documents
- Create a logical structure for the documentation
- Improve navigation and discoverability of Ash Framework concepts

## Activities

- Analyzed the existing large documentation file (docs/ash_framework_learnings.md)
- Created a dedicated directory for Ash Framework documentation (docs/ash_framework/)
- Extracted all major topics into separate files:
  - Relationships
  - Phoenix integration
  - Query preparations
  - Reusable changes
  - Multi-tenancy
  - Authentication
  - Access control
  - Testing
- Created an index file to organize all documentation (docs/ash_framework/index.md)
- Added table of contents and related information to each file
- Ensured consistent structure across all documentation files
- Added attribution to the original blog series by Lambert Kamaro in the index file
- Updated CLAUDE.md to reference the Ash Framework documentation

## Decisions

- Chose to organize documentation by major functional areas rather than by source material
- Created standalone files that can be referenced independently
- Designed a consistent structure for each document with:
  - Introduction
  - Table of contents
  - Logical section organization
  - Code examples
  - Key insights
- Created an index file to serve as a central navigation point
- Planned for future topic extractions in the index file

## Outcomes

- Created the following files:
  - docs/ash_framework/index.md - Main navigation document
  - docs/ash_framework/multitenancy.md - Multi-tenancy implementation
  - docs/ash_framework/relationships.md - Working with relationships
  - docs/ash_framework/phoenix_integration.md - Phoenix and LiveView integration
  - docs/ash_framework/query_preparations.md - Creating reusable query logic
  - docs/ash_framework/reusable_changes.md - Creating reusable change logic
  - docs/ash_framework/authentication.md - Implementing authentication
  - docs/ash_framework/access_control.md - Implementing permissions and authorization
  - docs/ash_framework/testing.md - Testing Ash applications
- Significantly improved the organization and maintainability of the documentation
- Made it easier to find specific information about Ash Framework concepts
- Established a pattern for future documentation organization
- Added framework reference sections to CLAUDE.md to help with ongoing development

## Learnings

### Documentation Organization
- Large, monolithic documentation files become unwieldy around 4,000 lines
- Topic-based organization improves findability and maintenance
- Clear section headings and consistent structure improve navigation
- Code examples should be contextualized with explanations of key concepts

### Knowledge Management
- Documentation should be organized around user tasks and concepts
- Documentation needs grow with project complexity
- Good navigation (index, TOC) is as important as the content itself
- Planning future documentation needs helps maintain structure

## Next Steps

- Consider adding a search mechanism or improved cross-referencing between documents
- Update existing code to reference the new documentation structure
- Add any future Ash Framework insights to the appropriate topic documents
- Removed the original monolithic document as it's no longer needed
- Consider creating a script to generate a full combined document from individual files if needed
