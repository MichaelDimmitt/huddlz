# Feature: Event Creation (Huddlz)

## Overview
Enable group owners and organizers to create huddlz (events) for their groups. This is the most fundamental feature of the platform - without huddlz, there's no way for people to know when or where to meet. This MVP implementation focuses on one-time event creation with basic RSVP tracking.

## User Stories
- As a group owner, I want to create huddlz for my group, so that members know when and where to meet
- As a group organizer, I want to create huddlz for groups I help manage, so that I can schedule meetups
- As a group member, I want to see upcoming huddlz for my groups, so that I can plan to attend
- As a user, I want to RSVP to huddlz, so that organizers know I'm coming
- As a user, I want to search and browse public huddlz, so that I can discover interesting events

## Implementation Sequence
1. ✅ Update Huddl Resource - Add new fields and relationships for events
2. ✅ Create Event Form - Build LiveView form for event creation
3. ✅ Implement Access Control - Ensure only owners/organizers can create events
4. ✅ Add Event Display - Show events on group pages and main listing
5. ✅ Implement RSVP System - Basic RSVP functionality with count display
6. ✅ Add Event Search - Enable searching/filtering of public events

## Success Criteria
- Group owners and organizers can create one-time events
- Events can be in-person, virtual, or hybrid
- Virtual links are only visible to attendees
- Private groups create private events only
- Public groups can create public or private events
- Users can RSVP to events they have access to
- RSVP count is displayed (not individual attendees)
- Events appear on group pages and main search page
- Past events cannot be created
- Event end time must be after start time

### Review Findings

#### ✅ Correctness
- All required event fields implemented in Huddl resource
- Event creation form properly handles all event types (in-person/virtual/hybrid)
- Business logic correctly enforces all requirements
- RSVP system works with atomic count updates and prevents duplicates
- Virtual link visibility properly controlled based on RSVP status

#### ✅ Completeness
- All success criteria met:
  - Group owners/organizers can create one-time events ✓
  - Events support in-person, virtual, or hybrid types ✓
  - Virtual links only visible to attendees ✓
  - Private groups create private events only ✓
  - Public groups can create public or private events ✓
  - Users can RSVP to accessible events ✓
  - RSVP count displayed (not individual attendees) ✓
  - Events appear on group pages and search page ✓
  - Past events cannot be created ✓
  - Event end time must be after start time ✓

#### ✅ Security
- Proper authorization checks at resource level
- Virtual links marked as sensitive information
- RSVP action requires user to RSVP for themselves only
- Private groups automatically force private huddls
- Admin bypass properly implemented

#### ✅ Code Quality
- Follows Elixir conventions and project standards
- Uses `with` statements for error handling as required
- Proper module organization and separation of concerns
- LiveView components well-structured with proper assigns

#### ⚠️ Performance Considerations
- Search implementation filters in-memory after fetching all huddls
- Could benefit from database-level filtering for large datasets
- Currently acceptable for MVP but should be optimized as scale increases

#### ✅ Testing
- Comprehensive test coverage for all functionality
- Access control scenarios thoroughly tested
- RSVP functionality edge cases covered
- Search and filtering properly tested

### Minor Observations (Non-Critical)
1. No UI for RSVP cancellation (backend supports it)
2. Attendee list not displayed (though policy allows for verified users)
3. Search could be optimized with database-level filtering
4. Some test helper duplication could be refactored

### Test Results
- Unit Tests: ✅ 192 tests, 0 failures
- Cucumber Tests: ✅ 25 tests, 0 failures
- Code Formatting: ✅ All files properly formatted
- Credo Linter: ✅ No issues in strict mode (314 modules/functions analyzed)
- No critical issues found - no fixes required

## Verification Results
- Completed: 2025-05-24
- Status: Passed
- Issues Found: 0 critical, 4 minor observations
- Issues Fixed: 0 (none required)
- Overall Assessment: Feature is production-ready with excellent implementation quality, comprehensive security, full test coverage, and all success criteria met
