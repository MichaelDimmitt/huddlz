# Session: Groups Feature Planning (May 6, 2025)

## Goals
- Analyze requirements for the Groups feature
- Create a comprehensive implementation plan
- Break down the feature into manageable tasks
- Enhance the project:plan command for better feature planning

## Activities

### Requirements Analysis
- Discussed core functionality needs for groups
- Determined user roles: admin, verified, and regular users
- Identified group attributes: name, description, location, image_url, is_public
- Established relationship between groups and huddlz (events)
- Clarified permissions for group creation and membership management

### Task Breakdown
Created a structured implementation plan with 8 sequential tasks:
1. Admin Panel Implementation - Allow admins to set user roles (verified/admin)
2. Create Communities Domain - Create new domain to house groups and huddlz
3. Group Resource Implementation - Create data model for groups
4. Generate Database Migrations - Set up database tables using Ash migrations
5. Move Huddl to Communities Domain - Reorganize code structure
6. Create Admin Panel - Build UI for user permission management
7. Implement Group Creation - Add UI for creating groups
8. Implement Group Membership - Enable joining/leaving groups

### Architecture Decisions
- Decided to create a new `Communities` domain to contain both Group and Huddl resources
- Designed Group-User relationship with owner and members
- Chose to implement private/public group settings for controlling visibility
- Determined to use role-based authorization for group creation (admin, verified)

### Project:Plan Enhancement
- Enhanced project:plan command with structured product management interview
- Added detailed requirements gathering phase
- Included technical assessment section
- Improved task documentation with user stories and success criteria

## Decisions
- Group creation will be limited to admins and verified users
- Groups will have public/private settings
- Huddlz will be moved from Huddls domain to Communities domain
- Each group must have an owner (the creator)
- Admin panel will manage user permissions

## Outcomes
- Comprehensive task breakdown for Groups feature implementation
- Detailed documentation for each implementation task
- Enhanced project:plan command for better feature planning
- Clear implementation sequence with dependencies identified

## Learnings
- Structured product management questions improve requirement gathering
- Breaking features into sequential tasks clarifies the implementation path
- Domain organization should reflect conceptual relationships between resources
- Clarifying permissions early avoids implementation issues later

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation with Admin Panel for user roles
- Create Communities domain with Group resource
- Generate migrations for new database tables
- Complete remaining tasks in sequence
