# Session: Workflow Improvement - Command Refactoring

**Date:** May 6, 2025

## Goals

- Create a streamlined development workflow for solo development
- Break down complex bake command into modular commands
- Add automatic session documentation
- Create a knowledge management system for capturing learnings
- Integrate UI design considerations into the workflow

## Activities

- Identified problems with the original bake.md workflow (too complex, too many phases)
- Created modular commands: plan, build, verify, reflect, resume
- Added quickfix command for small changes and bug fixes
- Created development_lifecycle.md to document the complete process
- Populated LEARNINGS.md with actual insights from existing documentation
- Updated README.md with workflow overview
- Added DaisyUI component selection to the planning phase
- Standardized terminology (req_id vs feature_id)
- Improved command examples with placeholders in commands and concrete examples in docs

## Decisions

- Chose a streamlined 4-phase core workflow (plan → build → verify → reflect)
- Decided to use automatic session documentation rather than a command
- Integrated DaisyUI component selection into planning rather than creating a separate design phase
- Standardized terminology:
  - `req_id` for references to requirements documents
  - "Feature" for what's being built
  - Using angle brackets in command files and concrete examples in docs
- Committed to using ripgrep (rg) over grep for searching

## Outcomes

- Created a complete, streamlined development workflow:
  - `/define` - Define requirements
  - `/plan` - Plan implementation
  - `/build` - Implement solution
  - `/verify` - Test and review
  - `/reflect` - Capture learnings
  - `/resume` - Recover context
  - `/quickfix` - Handle small changes
- Established a knowledge management system with LEARNINGS.md
- Added automatic session documentation to CLAUDE.md
- Created comprehensive docs/development_lifecycle.md
- Updated README.md with workflow overview

## Learnings

### Workflow Optimization
- Breaking down complex processes into modular commands improves flexibility
- Even solo development benefits from structured workflows
- Scaling process complexity based on task size is more efficient
- Session documentation is critical for maintaining context between AI interactions

### Command Design
- Consistent parameter naming is essential for usability
- Clear distinction between placeholders and examples improves clarity
- Commands should focus on one specific task with clear inputs and outputs
- Parameter comments should clearly explain purpose and format

### Knowledge Management
- Centralizing learnings in a structured document improves institutional knowledge
- Automatic documentation reduces friction in capturing insights
- Regular reflection on completed work yields valuable insights
- Categorizing learnings makes them more discoverable and useful

### UI Considerations
- Component libraries like DaisyUI can be integrated into the planning phase
- For projects using component libraries, separate design phase may be unnecessary
- Documenting component choices with links to documentation improves consistency

## Next Steps

- Test the workflow on real feature development
- Refine commands based on actual usage
- Consider creating a command for batch operations on multiple files
- Explore integration with testing and CI/CD workflows
- Periodically review and update LEARNINGS.md
- Consider visualizing the workflow with diagrams
