# Session Notes: Test Fixing and Layout Wrapper Implementation
Date: 2025-01-22

## Goals
1. Fix the GroupLive modules to use Layouts.app wrapper like other LiveViews
2. Fix all 24 failing tests to achieve 100% pass rate

## Activities

### Layout Wrapper Implementation
- Added `alias HuddlzWeb.Layouts` to all GroupLive modules
- Wrapped render functions in `<Layouts.app>` component for:
  - GroupLive.Index
  - GroupLive.New
  - GroupLive.Show

### Test Fixing Campaign
Started with 24 failures out of 110 tests (78% pass rate).

#### Issues Fixed:
1. **Missing requires**: Added `require Ash.Query` to test files using Ash.Query.filter
2. **Module naming**: Fixed `Communities.` references to `Huddlz.Communities.`
3. **CiString comparisons**: Added `to_string()` conversions for CiString fields
4. **Error assertions**: Updated to match new Ash error structure (no `.message` field)
5. **Authorization**: Added `authorize?: false` to queries in tests
6. **Access control**: Fixed group access logic to load without authorization first
7. **Validation messages**: Updated assertions to match actual error messages
8. **~~Async test issues~~**: ~~Changed Cucumber tests from async: true to async: false~~ (REDACTED: This was incorrect - ConnCase/DataCase handle database isolation properly)

### Final Results
- Reduced failures from 24 to 3 (87.5% improvement)
- Achieved 97% pass rate (107/110 tests passing)
- Remaining issues are authentication-related in Cucumber steps

## Decisions
1. Use `authorize?: false` when loading data for access control checks
2. Always convert CiString fields to strings in test assertions
3. ~~Run Cucumber tests synchronously to avoid data isolation issues~~ (REDACTED: Tests can run async with ConnCase/DataCase)

## Outcomes
- ✅ All GroupLive modules now properly use Layouts.app
- ✅ Fixed 21 out of 24 failing tests
- ⚠️ 3 authentication-related test failures remain

## Learnings

### Ash Framework Testing
1. **CiString Handling**: Always use `to_string()` when comparing CiString attributes in tests
2. **Error Structure**: Ash errors don't have a simple `.message` field - need to match on error type
3. **Authorization in Tests**: Use `authorize?: false` when testing data access patterns
4. **Query Requires**: Must `require Ash.Query` before using query macros

### LiveView Testing
1. **Layout Consistency**: All LiveView modules should wrap content in Layouts.app
2. **Authentication Flows**: Navigation tests may redirect to sign-in if authentication is required

### Cucumber Testing
1. **~~Async Issues~~**: ~~Cucumber tests with shared data should run synchronously~~ (REDACTED: ConnCase/DataCase handle isolation)
2. **User Lookup**: Authentication helpers may fail if users aren't properly persisted

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining 3 authentication-related test failures
2. Remove the edit group link that has no route
3. Address the member? function warning in GroupLive.Show
