# Huddlz

## Elevator Pitch
Huddlz is a social network that prioritizes real-life connections. Unlike traditional social networks that often keep people glued to their screens, Huddlz is designed to bring people together in person. It provides organizers with a simple, cost-effective platform to create and manage meetups, while offering attendees a privacy-conscious way to discover and join real-world events.

## Core Values
- **Real-Life First**: Technology should facilitate, not replace, human interaction
- **Privacy-Conscious**: Users control their visibility and personal information
- **Simplicity**: Easy to use for both organizers and attendees
- **Cost-Effective**: No extortionary fees for organizers
- **Open Platform**: Extensible API for community innovation

## Current Focus
Initial development focuses on supporting tech meetup organizers, specifically:
- Group meetup management
- Technical presentation/workshop coordination
- Social tech event organization

## Goals

### Short-term (1 year)
