# Soirée Listing Future Enhancements Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation approach for the future considerations identified in PRD #0001 for the Soirée Listing Landing Page. These features represent the next phases of development following the initial implementation.

## 1. Personalized Recommendations

### Technical Approach
- Implement a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering based on user interactions
- Track user engagement metrics (views, joins, completions) to build preference profiles
- Utilize PostgreSQL's array data type to store user interests and match with soirée topics

### Implementation Plan
1. Add `interests` field to User schema as an array of tags/categories
2. Create a `SoireeInteraction` join table to track user-soiree interactions
3. Implement a weighted scoring algorithm based on past behavior
4. Add a dedicated "Recommended for You" section to the landing page
5. Include explanation tooltips for why items are recommended

### Estimated Effort
- Backend: Medium (recommendation algorithm, data tracking)
- Frontend: Low (UI already supports card display)
- Data Migration: Low (only new tables needed)

## 2. Enhanced Filtering Options

### Technical Approach
- Implement location-based filtering using PostGIS extension for PostgreSQL
- Add geolocation support to soirées with optional user location sharing
- Create advanced filtering UI with multiple concurrent filter options

### Implementation Plan
1. Add PostGIS extension to the database
2. Add location fields to Soirée schema (latitude, longitude, address)
3. Create a radius-based search capability
4. Implement filter combination logic in the Soirée LiveView
5. Create expandable filter panel in the UI with multiple selection options

### Estimated Effort
- Backend: Medium (geo-queries, combined filtering logic)
- Frontend: Medium (filter UI, location permission handling)
- Data Migration: Medium (adding PostGIS, location data)

## 3. Social Attendance Features

### Technical Approach
- Create a many-to-many relationship between Users and Soirées for attendance
- Implement friend/connection system between users
- Add visibility controls for attendance information

### Implementation Plan
1. Create `SoireeAttendance` schema with user_id, soiree_id, and status fields
2. Implement `UserConnection` schema for friendships/connections
3. Add privacy settings to control attendance visibility
4. Update soirée cards to show attending connections
5. Add "Friends Attending" filter option

### Estimated Effort
- Backend: High (connection system, privacy controls)
- Frontend: Medium (attendance UI, friend displays)
- Data Migration: Low (new join tables)

## 4. Featured/Trending Sections

### Technical Approach
- Implement activity scoring algorithm to identify trending soirées
- Add admin capability to manually feature soirées
- Create dedicated UI sections for these special categories

### Implementation Plan
1. Add `featured` boolean field to Soirée schema
2. Create admin interface for managing featured soirées
3. Implement trending algorithm based on view/join velocity
4. Add horizontal scrolling sections at the top of the landing page
5. Implement visual distinction for featured/trending items

### Estimated Effort
- Backend: Low (simple scoring, admin features)
- Frontend: Medium (new UI sections, visual treatments)
- Data Migration: Low (minimal schema changes)

## 5. Calendar View

### Technical Approach
- Implement a calendar-based visualization option for soirées
- Support day, week, and month views
- Enable direct interaction with soirées from the calendar

### Implementation Plan
1. Create a new `CalendarLive` LiveView component
2. Implement date-based grouping of soirées
3. Create toggle between grid and calendar views
4. Add calendar-specific filtering (by day, week, month)
5. Implement soirée preview on calendar item hover/click

### Estimated Effort
- Backend: Low (date-based queries already supported)
- Frontend: High (calendar UI, date handling, responsive design)
- Data Migration: None (uses existing data)

## 6. Calendar App Integration

### Technical Approach
- Generate standard calendar format (iCal) exports for soirées
- Create direct integration with popular calendar providers (Google, Outlook, Apple)
- Implement calendar subscription options for ongoing updates

### Implementation Plan
1. Create iCal/vCal generation service for soirées
2. Implement OAuth flows for major calendar providers
3. Add "Add to Calendar" buttons on soirée detail pages
4. Create subscription URL for ongoing soirée updates
5. Implement email reminders for upcoming soirées

### Estimated Effort
- Backend: Medium (calendar format generation, OAuth integration)
- Frontend: Low (integration buttons, confirmation dialogs)
- External Dependencies: High (third-party API integration)

## Prioritization Matrix

| Feature | User Value | Implementation Complexity | Technical Risk | Recommended Phase |
|---------|------------|---------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Personalized Recommendations | High | Medium | Medium | 2 |
| Enhanced Filtering | High | Medium | Low | 1 |
| Social Attendance | Medium | High | Medium | 3 |
| Featured/Trending Sections | Medium | Low | Low | 1 |
| Calendar View | Medium | High | Low | 2 |
| Calendar App Integration | High | Medium | Medium | 2 |

## Next Steps

Based on the prioritization matrix, we recommend:

1. **Phase 1** (Next Release):
   - Implement Enhanced Filtering
   - Add Featured/Trending Sections

2. **Phase 2** (Following Release):
   - Implement Personalized Recommendations
   - Add Calendar View
   - Implement Calendar App Integration

3. **Phase 3** (Future Release):
   - Implement Social Attendance Features
   - Add additional social integration capabilities

This phased approach balances user value with implementation complexity while managing technical risk appropriately.
