# Implementation Notes: Soirée Listing Landing Page (PRD #0001)

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation approach taken for PRD #0001, which required creating a landing page that displays soirée listings to immediately showcase value to users visiting huddlz.com.

## Implementation Approach

### Data Model & Backend

1. **Soirée Schema**
   - Created `Soiree` as an Ash Resource with attributes matching requirements
   - Added fields for title, description, timestamps, host relationship, status
   - Implemented uniqueness constraint on title per host using identity
   - Used UUID for primary key following project conventions

2. **Soirées Context**
   - Defined domain-level operations through Ash Framework
   - Created specialized read actions for filtering:
     - `by_status` for filtering soirées by status
     - `upcoming` for fetching future soirées
     - `search` for text-based filtering

3. **Data Generation**
   - Implemented generators for creating test and seed data
   - Used Faker for realistic, randomized content
   - Created sequence-based generators for unique titles

### Frontend Implementation

1. **LiveView Component**
   - Implemented `SoireeLive` as the root route LiveView
   - Optimized for performance with deferred loading (only load soirées when socket connected)
   - Implemented search functionality with real-time filtering

2. **UI Design**
   - Created responsive card-based layout following modern design patterns
   - Implemented visual indicators for soirée status
   - Added placeholder images with consistent styling
   - Designed for mobile-first with responsive grid layout

3. **Authentication Integration**
   - Used optional authentication to allow both logged-in and anonymous users
   - Leveraged existing authentication system with `LiveUserAuth`

### Testing Strategy

1. **BDD Tests with Cucumber**
   - Created feature file describing user behavior with Gherkin syntax
   - Implemented step definitions to test key functionality:
     - Listing display
     - Search capabilities
     - Basic information visibility

2. **Test Fixtures**
   - Created reusable test fixtures using Ash Generators
   - Ensured test isolation and repeatability

## Technical Decisions

1. **Ash Framework Usage**
   - Leveraged Ash Resources for the data model to align with project structure
   - Used built-in filtering capabilities for efficient queries
   - Implemented proper relationships between hosts and soirées

2. **LiveView for Interactivity**
   - Chose LiveView for real-time search without full page reloads
   - Used phx-change for immediate search updates
   - Optimized initial page load by deferring data fetching

3. **Data Seeding Approach**
   - Created generators in domain-specific locations
   - Used sequence generators for uniqueness
   - Implemented idempotent seed scripts that check for existing data

## Challenges & Solutions

1. **Ash Generator Integration**
   - Challenge: Initial difficulty with proper Ash Generator syntax
   - Solution: Researched documentation and implemented correct seed_generator pattern

2. **Testing with Non-ASCII Characters**
   - Challenge: Cucumber tests failed with non-ASCII characters in feature files
   - Solution: Modified step definitions to support both ASCII and non-ASCII text

3. **Uniqueness Constraints**
   - Challenge: Identity constraints causing issues in tests
   - Solution: Created test fixtures that handle existing data properly

## Future Improvements

1. **Pagination**
   - Add pagination or infinite scroll for large numbers of soirées

2. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Implement more advanced filtering options (by date range, category, etc.)
   - Add sorting capabilities

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Consider preloading key relationships
   - Optimize queries for larger datasets

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Add animations for card transitions
   - Implement skeleton loading states

## Conclusion

The implemented solution satisfies all requirements specified in PRD #0001, providing users with immediate value when visiting huddlz.com by showcasing available soirées. The implementation follows project standards, uses existing authentication mechanisms, and includes comprehensive test coverage.
