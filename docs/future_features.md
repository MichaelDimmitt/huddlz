# Future Features

This document tracks feature ideas that we want to implement in the future but aren't ready to prioritize yet.

## Huddlz CLI Tool

A command-line interface for managing Huddlz development and potentially user tasks.

### Potential Commands:
```bash
# Development commands
huddlz dev start          # Start development server
huddlz dev test          # Run tests
huddlz dev format        # Format code

# Task management (future)
huddlz task add "Implement theming system"
huddlz task list --status=active
huddlz task complete ui-consistency

# Feature voting (future integration)
huddlz feature vote "dark-mode"
huddlz feature list --top=10
```

### Benefits:
- Streamlined development workflow
- Could integrate with in-app feature voting
- Mix task wrapper with enhanced functionality
- Could generate release notes from completed tasks

## In-App Feature Voting System

Build a feature request and voting system directly into Huddlz.

### Components:
1. **Feature Request Resource** (Ash)
   - Title, description, category
   - Vote count, status
   - User associations

2. **Public Roadmap Page**
   - View proposed features
   - Vote without authentication
   - See what's planned/in-progress

3. **Admin Management**
   - Move features between statuses
   - Link to GitHub issues
   - Announce completed features

### Benefits:
- Dogfood our own collaboration tools
- Increase user engagement
- Transparent development process
- Test bed for new Ash patterns

### Implementation Ideas:
- Could start simple: just a list with vote counts
- Later: comments, discussions, updates
- Export to markdown for git history
- Sync with GitHub Projects API

## Other Future Ideas

### Huddlz Analytics Dashboard
- Built-in analytics for groups and huddlz
- Privacy-focused, self-hosted
- Help organizers understand engagement

### Plugin System
- Allow groups to add custom features
- Marketplace for themes/extensions
- API for third-party integrations
