## Version Information
- PRD ID: 0001
- Date Created: 2025-05-04
- Version: 1.0
- Author: Micah Woods
- Status: Draft

## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Problem Statement
Users currently don't see immediate value when visiting huddlz.com, requiring additional navigation to discover available soirées (events).

### 1.2 User Need
First-time visitors and returning users need to immediately see available soirées to quickly understand the platform's value and find events of interest without additional navigation steps.

### 1.3 Business Objectives
- Increase user engagement by showcasing content immediately
- Reduce bounce rate by eliminating empty landing experiences
- Drive event participation by making soirées the primary call-to-action
- Differentiate from competitors that use splash pages or traditional sign-up walls

## 2. Requirements
### 2.1 Functional Requirements
1. Display a visually appealing grid or list of upcoming soirées directly on the landing page (huddlz.com)
2. Show key information for each soirée: title, date/time, host, and thumbnail image
3. Support filtering or categorization of soirées to help users find relevant events
4. Implement pagination or infinite scroll if the number of soirées exceeds the initial display limit
5. Enable non-authenticated users to view soirée details without requiring sign-up
6. Provide clear visual cues for soirées that are happening soon or are trending
7. Include a search functionality to find specific soirées

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
1. Page load time should not exceed 2 seconds for initial content display
2. The landing page must be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
3. Design should follow Huddlz brand guidelines and maintain visual consistency
4. Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
5. SEO optimization for soirée content to improve discoverability
6. Support for low-bandwidth connections with appropriate loading states

### 2.3 Constraints
1. Must work within the existing Phoenix LiveView architecture
2. Authentication state must be respected (showing different options for logged-in vs. anonymous users)
3. Must comply with data privacy regulations regarding public event information

## 3. User Experience
### 3.1 User Journey
1. User navigates to huddlz.com
2. Landing page immediately loads with a curated selection of upcoming soirées
3. User can scroll through available soirées without taking any additional actions
4. User can filter or search for specific types of soirées
5. User clicks on a soirée card to view detailed information
6. User is presented with clear options to join/RSVP to the soirée (with authentication if required)
7. After interacting with a soirée, user can easily return to the main listing

### 3.2 UI/UX Considerations
1. Soirée cards should be visually distinctive and contain enough information without overwhelming users
2. Use animation and transitions judiciously to create a dynamic but not distracting experience
3. Implement progressive loading techniques to ensure users see content as quickly as possible
4. Search and filter controls should be easily accessible but not dominate the visual hierarchy
5. Empty states must be handled gracefully if no soirées match current filters
6. Include visual indicators for soirée status (upcoming, in progress, full, etc.)

## 4. Technical Considerations
### 4.1 System Components
1. Phoenix LiveView for the dynamic landing page experience
2. Database queries optimized for soirée listing and filtering
3. Image optimization and caching for soirée thumbnails
4. Client-side state management for filters and pagination

### 4.2 Dependencies
1. Existing soirée data model and database schema
2. Authentication system for differentiating between user states
3. Image storage and CDN for soirée visual assets
4. Search indexing for quick soirée discovery

### 4.3 Integration Points
1. Authentication system to determine user state and personalization options
2. Database for retrieving soirée information
3. Notification system for highlighting relevant soirées to users
4. Analytics to track engagement with different soirées and listing formats

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
1. Landing page loads and displays at least 6-10 upcoming soirées within 2 seconds
2. All soirée information is accurately displayed and properly formatted
3. Filtering and search functionality returns expected results
4. Responsive design functions correctly across devices with screen widths from 320px to 1920px
5. Authentication state is properly recognized and reflected in the UI
6. Performance metrics show improved engagement compared to previous landing experience
7. All accessibility requirements are met and verified
8. SEO analysis confirms improved discoverability for soirée content

## 6. Out of Scope
1. Full soirée creation or management functionality
2. User profile or account management features
3. Complex recommendation algorithms (basic sorting and filtering only in initial version)
4. Integration with external calendar systems or social platforms
5. Real-time chat or messaging features
6. Monetization features for premium or sponsored soirées

## 7. Future Considerations
1. Personalized soirée recommendations based on user interests and history
2. Enhanced filtering options including location-based searching
3. Social features to see which friends are attending soirées
4. "Featured" or "Trending" sections for special soirées
