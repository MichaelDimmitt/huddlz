## Version Information
- PRD ID: 0002
- Date Created: May 5, 2025
- Version: 1.0
- Status: Draft

## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Problem Statement
Without a signup feature, potential users cannot access and participate in events on the platform. This limits user growth and engagement with the core functionalities of the product.

### 1.2 User Need
First-time visitors to the platform need a simple, frictionless way to create accounts so they can join events and engage with the platform's features.

### 1.3 Business Objectives
- Increase user acquisition by providing a low-friction signup process
- Build a user base that can participate in events and other platform activities
- Establish the foundation for future user authentication and account management features

## 2. Requirements
### 2.1 Functional Requirements
1. Users must be able to initiate signup by entering their email address
2. System must validate that the email contains an "@" symbol
3. System must generate and send a magic link to the provided email address
4. Magic links must be securely generated and include appropriate expiration
5. Users must be able to complete signup by clicking the magic link in their email
6. After magic link verification, users must provide their display name
7. System must create and activate the user account upon completion of the flow
8. Users must be automatically signed in after completing the signup process

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
1. The signup form must be responsive and function correctly on mobile and desktop
2. Magic links must be delivered promptly, ideally within one minute of request
3. The signup flow should be completed within 2-3 minutes maximum
4. The system must handle concurrent signup requests appropriately

### 2.3 Constraints
1. Must use email magic links as the authentication method (no passwords)
2. Initial implementation does not need to support alternative signup methods

## 3. User Experience
### 3.1 User Journey
1. User visits the platform and sees a "Sign Up" or "Join" button
2. User clicks the button and is presented with an email input form
3. User enters their email address and submits the form
4. System validates the email format (contains "@")
5. System sends a magic link to the provided email address
6. User receives a confirmation screen instructing them to check their email
7. User checks their email and clicks the magic link
8. User is directed back to the platform where they're prompted to enter their display name
9. User enters their name and completes the signup process
10. User is automatically signed in and directed to an appropriate starting page

### 3.2 UI/UX Considerations
1. Signup form should be clean, simple, and focused
2. Appropriate feedback should be provided for form validation
3. Clear instructions should guide users through the magic link process
4. Confirmation screens should set appropriate expectations about next steps
5. Error states should provide clear guidance on how to resolve issues

## 4. Technical Considerations
### 4.1 System Components
1. Frontend signup form and validation
2. Backend API endpoints for email submission and validation
3. Magic link generation and authentication system
4. Email delivery service
5. User database and model

### 4.2 Dependencies
1. Email delivery system
2. User authentication and session management system
3. Database for storing user information

### 4.3 Integration Points
1. Integration with existing or new user database/model
2. Integration with email delivery service
3. Integration with frontend routing and session management

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can successfully sign up using only their email (for magic link) and name
2. Email validation correctly prevents submission of emails without "@" symbol
3. Magic links are generated with appropriate security measures and expirations
4. Magic links successfully authenticate users when clicked
5. Users can enter their display name after magic link validation
6. User accounts are properly created with all required information
7. Users are automatically signed in after completing the signup process
8. The entire flow works correctly on both mobile and desktop devices

## 6. Out of Scope
1. Traditional password-based authentication
2. Social media authentication options
3. Complex user profile creation beyond display name
4. Account settings or profile management features
5. User role management or permissions beyond basic authentication

## 7. Future Considerations
1. Additional authentication methods (social logins, etc.)
2. Enhanced profile creation and customization
3. User preferences and settings management
4. Email verification for critical account actions
5. Account recovery flows
