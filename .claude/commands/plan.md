    # Task Decomposition Planning
    
    This command analyzes a GitHub issue and creates a local file structure for managing implementation.
    
    ## Initial Setup
    
    1. Fetch issue details using gh CLI:
       ```
       gh issue view {{ params.issue }} --json title,body,labels,assignees,milestone
       ```
    
    2. Extract requirements from issue:
       - Parse issue body for requirements
       - Identify acceptance criteria
       - Note any technical specifications
       - Create sanitized title for directory name
    
    3. Create local task structure:
       ```
       tasks/issue-{{ params.issue }}/
       â”œâ”€â”€ index.md          # Requirements and plan
       â”œâ”€â”€ session.md        # Implementation notes
       â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/            # Individual task files
       â””â”€â”€ learnings.md      # Accumulated insights
       ```
    
    4. Create feature branch:
       ```
       git checkout -b feature/issue-{{ params.issue }}-[short-description]
       ```
    
    ## Requirements Analysis
    
    Conduct thorough requirements analysis with PM mindset:
    
    1. Ask clarifying questions about the feature:
       - What problem does this solve for users?
       - Who are the primary users?
       - What specific actions should users be able to perform?
       - What are the constraints or limitations?
       - How does this integrate with existing features?
    
    2. Deep dive into specifics:
       - Data requirements: What information needs to be stored/displayed?
       - User flows: Walk through the typical user journey
       - Edge cases: What happens in unexpected scenarios?
       - Access control: Who can perform these actions?
       - Performance: Any specific performance requirements?
    
    3. Continue until you have:
       - Clear scope boundaries
       - Specific functional requirements
       - Non-functional requirements
       - Measurable success criteria
    
    ## Create Index File

    ```
    
    ## Technical Assessment
    
    Document in index.md:
    
    1. Data modeling:
       - Database schema changes
       - New Ecto schemas needed
       - Relationships between entities
    
    2. Business logic:
       - Ash actions required
       - Authorization policies
       - Validations and checks
    
    3. User interface:
       - LiveView components needed
       - Forms and interactions
       - Real-time updates
    
    4. Testing strategy:
       - Unit test scenarios
       - Integration test needs
       - Feature/behavior tests
    
    ## Task File Creation
    
    For each task, create `tasks/issue-{{ params.issue }}/tasks/0N-[name].md`:
    
    ```markdown
    # Task N: [Task Name]
    
    **Status**: pending
    **Created**: [Date/Time]

    ```
    
    ## Important Guidelines
    
    1. **Task Sizing**:
       - Aim for 2-4 hour tasks
       - If larger, break down further
       - Each task = one focused commit set
    
    2. **Clear Boundaries**:
       - No overlap between tasks
       - Explicit scope statements
       - Clear handoff points
    
    3. **Documentation**:
       - Session notes capture the journey
       - Task files track specific progress
       - Learnings accumulate throughout
