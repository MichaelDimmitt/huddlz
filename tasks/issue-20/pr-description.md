## Summary

Migrates the entire test suite to use PhoenixTest, providing a consistent API for testing both LiveViews and regular controller views. This eliminates API inconsistencies and simplifies test maintenance.

Closes #20

## Changes

### Test Framework Migration
- Added PhoenixTest dependency and configuration
- Migrated all 7 Cucumber step definition files to PhoenixTest
- Migrated all 80 LiveView unit tests across 6 test files
- Migrated 4 integration tests to PhoenixTest patterns
- Removed Phoenix.LiveViewTest imports from all test files

### Code Improvements
- Added proper form labels for better testability and accessibility
- Fixed all compilation warnings in test files
- Simplified test assertions using PhoenixTest's cleaner API
- Removed conditionals that handled LiveView vs dead view differences

### Documentation
- Updated testing section in LEARNINGS.md with migration patterns
- Created comprehensive learnings document for future reference
- Documented PhoenixTest limitations and workarounds

## Testing

### How to Test
1. Run the full test suite: `mix test`
2. Run Cucumber tests specifically: `mix test test/features/`
3. Run credo for code quality: `mix credo --strict`
4. Check formatting: `mix format --check-formatted`

### Test Coverage
- All 209 tests passing (one duplicate test removed)
- No compilation warnings
- No credo issues
- Code properly formatted

## Key Learnings

1. **PhoenixTest is a wrapper, not a replacement** - It builds on top of Phoenix's testing infrastructure rather than replacing it entirely.

2. **Accessibility matters** - PhoenixTest's requirement for proper form labels led to better HTML semantics and improved accessibility throughout the application.

3. **Test visible outcomes** - When framework limitations arose (like flash message capture in LiveView), focusing on visible UI changes provided more reliable tests.

## Migration Patterns

The migration established clear patterns for future test writing:

```elixir
# Navigation
session = conn |> visit("/path")

# Form interaction
session
|> fill_in("Label", with: "value")
|> select("Dropdown", option: "Choice")
|> click_button("Submit")

# Assertions
assert_has(session, "h1", text: "Expected")
refute_has(session, ".error")
```

## Notes

- PhoenixTest cannot capture flash messages in LiveView (known limitation)
- Forms must have proper labels with `for` attributes for `fill_in` to work
- The consistent API significantly simplifies test maintenance and readability
